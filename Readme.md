# How does it work
This tool is for approximately finding the total cache size of CPU. After creating arrays in increasing order and then reads random values from arrays, the ratio of the time spend in read/write operation to the size of array gives us a clue about are caches filled up. 

L1 and L2 timing differences are not very noticeable but after filling up L3, you can see in the plot how the ratio changes. 

In python script, firstly compile&run program. Then takes the output of the program (array size and ratio) and use noise filter. "polyValues" are polynomial coefficients of polynomial fitted to our results. Rest of the script basically try to find where concavity changes (point of inflection (POI)). Because there will be many POI, only one of them is true. If you have a higher polynomial degree, you will get more POI. 

You can see plots with filter and raw.

# How to use

Just run "printplot.py". It will compile and run the program and then print plot.

`python printplot.pys`

While running the program, I recommend close all other working programs. Also, you don't need to run the compiled program every time if you didn't change "cache_measurment.cpp".

You can check the result correct with:

`lscpu | egrep cache`

Have Fun!!!
